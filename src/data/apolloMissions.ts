      `One of the worst tragedies in the history of spaceflight occurred on January 27, 1967 when the crew of Gus
                  Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed in a fire in the Apollo Command Module during a preflight
                  test at Cape Canaveral. They were training for the first crewed Apollo flight, an Earth orbiting mission
                  scheduled to be launched on 21 February. They were taking part in a "plugs-out" test, in which the Command
                  Module was mounted on the Saturn 1B on the launch pad just as it would be for the actual launch, but the
                  Saturn 1B was not fueled. The plan was to go through an entire countdown sequence.`!,

                  demonstrate Command and Service Module (CSM), crew, launch vehicle, and mission support facilities
                  performance and to demonstrate CSM rendezvous capability. Two photographic experiments and three medical

                  the Lunar Module was behind schedule and NASA wanted to maintain its launch schedule with the goal 
                  attempting the first lunar landing in summer 1969. Because of that, and in light of the highly 
                  successfull Apollo 7 mission, NASA made the audacious decision to send Apollo 8 to the Moon, despite 
                  that fact that was only the second Apollo flight with a human crew and the third launch of the Saturn V

                  The crew was Commander James McDivitt, Command Module (CM) pilot David Scott, and LM pilot Russell
                  Schweickart. The primary objective of the mission was to test all aspects of the Lunar Module in Earth
                  orbit, including operation of the LM as an independent self-sufficient spacecraft and performance of
                  docking and rendezvous manuevers. The goal was to simulate maneuvers which would be performed in actual
                  lunar missions. Other concurrent objectives included overall checkout of launch vehicle and spacecraft
                  systems, crew, and procedures. A multispectral photographic experiment was also performed.`,

    description: `Apollo 10 was launched on May 18, 1969 and performed the final dress rehearsal for the first landing on
                  the Moon. The crew entered lunar orbit on May 21. On May 22, Commander Thomas Stafford and Lunar Module
                  Pilot Eugene Cernan flew the Lunar Module, Snoopy, on an independent test flight while Command Module
                  Pilot John Young remained in the Command Module, Charlie Brown. Stafford and Cernan flew as low as 16 km
                  above the Moon, testing the operation of the descent and ascent engines, the performance of the landing
                  and rendezvous radars, and the ability of the Lunar Module radio system to communicate with Earth and with
                  the Command Module. They made two low altitude passes over planned the Apollo 11 landing site, taking
                  detailed photographs to assess landing site safety. After a flight of slightly more than 8 hours, Snoopy
                  redocked with Charlie Brown. An additional day was spent photographing the Moon from the Command Module at
                  an altitude of about 110 km above the lunar surface. Altogether, Apollo 10 spent 2.6 days in lunar orbit,
                  orbiting the Moon 31 times. The crew returned safely to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on May 26
                  after a flight of 8 days and 3 minutes. Apollo 10 successfully completed all of its primary objectives,

                  The planned landing site in the Sea of Tranquility was selected as a flat, safe location and had been
                  surveyed by Apollo 10 at an elevation of 10 miles above the Moon. However, a navigation error earlier in
